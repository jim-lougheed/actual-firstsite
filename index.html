                    KitchenCompanion uses the Spoonacular API to retrieve and
                    display thousands of different recipes and allows users to
                    sort/filter them according to different search criteria.
                    This includes being able to filter recipes based on
                    ingredients that the user has on hand, which is saved in the
                    application's state, as well as a random selector wheel that
                    chooses a recipe randomly for easy meal decisions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The application also uses a number of Ant Design components
                    for a smooth user experience.

                    I initially explored several different recipe APIs to find
                    the functionality I wanted. After selecting one, I ended up
                    having to make a change halfway through the project due to a
                    lack of one category of information I needed.

                  <p>
                    The Dinner Wheel was easy to build with Winwheel.js, but
                    manipulating the funcionality proved to be difficult. I was
                    able to modify the dependency package to get the results I
                    wanted after many hours of scouring Stack Overflow.

                    With only two weeks to get a working product, I was amazed
                    at what I could build in such a short amount of time.
                    Despite all the moving parts and discovering what I could
                    and could not complete in the given timeframe, I am so proud
                    to have integrated all the moving parts well and deliver an
                    application so full of good functionality.

                    Despite my ability to customize the functionality of
                    Winwheel.js, I also had trouble maintaining it after
                    deploying the application. However, this opened me to the
                    experience of modifying the dependency, saving it to my
                    GitHub and using my own dependency in the project -
                    something I would not have had to experiment with otherwise.

                    This React application makes calls to the PokéAPI on the
                    Node back end, while the front end filters data to sort
                    encounter methods, conditions and Pokemon levels.

                    As I moved the information retrieved from the API down
                    through the components, it became increasingly challenging
                    to filter out irrelevant information.

                    Using CSS Grid also proved to be difficult in terms of
                    responsiveness. However, I was able to learn much more about
                    how Grid really works.

                    This project really helped me cement my understanding of
                    JavaScript higher-order functions, as I often needed to use
                    .map(), .filter(), and .any() in order to separate and
                    compile retrieved information to display in the appropriate
                    component.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was able to set the application up to easily add game and
                    route information for any of the other games in the main
                    series by adding an array of route information. As I am
                    able, I will be adding this information in without adjusting
                    the app's functionality.

                    This Single-Page Application uses a simple JavaScript file
                    that stores colour strings in two arrays - one "chosen" by
                    the game, the other clicked by the player - and compares
                    them before proceeding or restarting the game.

                    As my first JavaScript project, this game really challenged
                    my understanding of using functions to follow logic.
                    Understanding how to break down each step into smaller steps
                    was key!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, the Simon game tested my ability to iterate
                    through and add to arrays, and then to validate their
                    values.

                    Completing this challenge solidified my grasp of project
                    flow and the importance of breaking down tasks.

                  <p>
                    It also showed me the advantage of clean, reusable code to
                    make it easier to understand and use.

                Last year, a couple good friends introduced me to the world of
                web development. Although my previous roles were challenging in
                their own ways, I was eager to take on a new challenge and learn
                to create applications with my own two hands. Having learned a
                lot about the way different human languages work, learning
                computer languages to start coding seemed like a natural next
                step. With each day, I learn more, build more and grow more
                curious about the endless possibilities of software development.

                thoughts.

                It's no secret I have a killer sweettooth, nor is it that it is spoiled

                elegant and sugary desserts (and then enjoy sinking my teeth
                into the desserts themselves!). I've come a long way, but I have
                a lot to learn and bake before I earn the title of Star Baker.

                From the moment I received my first console (Nintendo 64) one Christmas, I've had
                a passion for gaming. A good game brings you into its
                constructed world and lets you explore and solve challenges
                within its constructs, and it's exactly this feeling of
                immersion that I keep coming back for.
